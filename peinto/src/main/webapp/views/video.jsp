          <p>Paint is any liquid, liquefiable,
		  or mastic composition that, 
		  after application to a substrate in a thin layer, 
		  converts to a solid film.
		  It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects.
		  Paint can be made or purchased in many colorsâ€”and in many different types, such as watercolor, synthetic, etc. 
		  Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid.
		 Ancient colored walls at Dendera, Egypt, which were exposed for years to the elements, still possess their brilliant color, as vivid as when they were painted about 2,000 years ago. The Egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance, and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture. They appear to have used six colors: white, black, blue, red, yellow, and green. They first covered the area entirely with white, then traced the design in black, leaving out the lights of the ground color. They used minium for red, and generally of a dark tinge.

Pliny mentions some painted ceilings in his day in the town of Ardea, which had been done prior to the foundation of Rome. He expresses great surprise and admiration at their freshness, after the lapse of so many centuries.
